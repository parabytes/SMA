No, there’s people who live almost nothing and they seem to survive. What we would see is a marked increase in mortgage and loan defaults. The long term damage to the economy from this is hard to gauge since we have other financial crisis before and seemed to weather it just fine. As I’ve stated in the previous comment that the initial pandemic spending was probably needed and saved a lot of people from insolvency. Now I’m not sure that continued spending to this level is needed or sustainable. 

I hope that the pandemic is wake up call for many Canadians that we need to be more prepared for the next financial emergency and it’s time for Canadians to start saving emergency funds. We can’t expect the government to bail us out every time life gets difficult.
